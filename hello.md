# Introduction

Hello everyone! 

I'm Abdelrahman Zeidan, a software engineer from Egypt. I really enjoy working with computers to create cool things. Outside of work, I love playing and watching football. I also spend time playing the Fantasy Premier League game. 

I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you and sharing our interests.
